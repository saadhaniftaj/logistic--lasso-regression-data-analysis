# Iris Dataset Analysis with Coordinate Descent

## Overview
This project explores the Iris dataset, focusing on:
1. **Binary Classification**: Using Logistic Regression and coordinate descent to classify two species.
2. **Feature Selection**: Applying Lasso regression with coordinate descent to select key features predicting petal length.
3. **Data Visualization**: Displaying distributions and relationships between features.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and encodes the Iris dataset, making it ready for machine learning.
- **Coordinate Descent for Logistic Regression**: Implements a logistic regression classifier for a binary subset of species in the Iris dataset.
- **Lasso Regression for Feature Selection**: Uses Lasso regularization to identify important features for predicting petal length.
- **Visualization**: Provides histograms and scatter plots to illustrate feature distributions and relationships.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook `DS_221_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell sequentially to see preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

## Key Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: Achieves classification accuracy for binary classification using logistic regression.
- **Lasso Regression Coefficients**: Highlights features with the strongest impact on petal length.

## Conclusion
